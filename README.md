# Scribble Theme for Zola
Preview: https://scribble.jzbor.de

This is my custom homepage theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org).
I created it for [my personal homepage](https://jzbor.de).

Features:
* Uses no JavaScript.
* Supports dark and light mode, using whichever the user prefers.
* Ability to disallow LLMs in `robots.txt` (enabled via `extra.robots_txt.no_llm`).
* Optionally supports analytics with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) (requires JavaScript)
* Card view for projects or similar listings.


## Forking and Contributing
You are encouraged to fork this theme and customize it to your likings.

Please avoid just using the theme on your site as is.
Try applying some customization of your own.
For example you can change the colors to fit your personal preference (you can find them in [`sass/style-light.scss`](sass/style-light.scss) and [`sass/style-dark.scss`](sass/style-dark.scss)).
