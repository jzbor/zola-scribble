# Scribble Theme for Zola

This is my custom homepage theme for [Zola](https://getzola.org).
I created it for [my personal homepage](https://jzbor.de).

Features:
* Uses no JavaScript.
* Supports dark and light mode, using whichever the user prefers.
* Ability to disallow LLMs in `robots.txt` (enabled via `extra.robots_txt.no_llm`).
* Optionally supports analytics with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) (requires JavaScript)


## Forking and Contributing
You are encouraged to fork this theme and customize it to your likings.

Please don't just use the theme on your site as is.
Try applying some customization of your own.
For example you can change the colors to fit your personal preference (you can find them in [`sass/style-light.scss`](sass/style-light.scss) and [`sass/style-dark.scss`](sass/style-dark.scss)).

Contributions are currently not accepted.
